# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a demo-ready dashboard. The system will allow users to upload documents, ask questions about them, and receive AI-generated answers based on relevant document chunks retrieved from a vector database. The dashboard will be clean, modern, and suitable for client demonstrations and Loom recordings.

3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display file names and processing status indicators
4. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user
5. IF a user uploads an unsupported file format THEN the system SHALL reject the file and show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Document Processing and Embedding

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded documents to be automatically processed and embedded, so that the system can retrieve relevant information when I ask questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL split it into chunks of 500-1000 tokens with overlap
2. WHEN chunking is complete THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using OpenAI embeddings API
3. WHEN embedding is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress loader with estimated time
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in Chroma or Pinecone vector database
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 3: Query Interface and Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enter natural language questions about my uploaded documents, so that I can get relevant answers based on the document content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the query interface THEN the system SHALL provide a text input field for natural language questions
2. WHEN the query interface loads THEN the system SHALL display example queries for user guidance
3. WHEN a user submits an empty query THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate validation message
4. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL validate the input before processing
5. IF no documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL prevent query submission and show an informative message

### Requirement 4: Information Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to find the most relevant information from my documents, so that I receive accurate and contextual answers to my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is submitted THEN the system SHALL retrieve the top 5 most relevant document chunks
2. WHEN retrieval is complete THEN the system SHALL optionally display retrieved context snippets for transparency
3. WHEN retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN retrieval is successful THEN the system SHALL log retrieval time for performance monitoring
5. IF no relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no relevant information was found

### Requirement 5: Answer Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear, structured answers to my questions, so that I can quickly understand the information from my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN relevant chunks are retrieved THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4o to generate a structured answer
2. WHEN generating answers THEN the system SHALL use a system prompt that ensures accurate and concise responses
3. WHEN an answer is generated THEN the system SHALL format it with bullets and sections for clarity
4. WHEN generation is complete THEN the system SHALL log generation time and token usage
5. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry

### Requirement 6: Answer Display and Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily view and interact with the generated answers, so that I can efficiently use the information provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an answer is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a clear, readable format
2. WHEN an answer is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a one-click copy button
3. WHEN the copy button is clicked THEN the system SHALL copy the answer to the user's clipboard
4. WHEN a "Show Context" toggle is available THEN the system SHALL display retrieved snippets with highlighted matches
5. WHEN context is shown THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between the generated answer and source context

### Requirement 7: Dashboard Visualization and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see summary information about my documents and queries, so that I can understand the system's activity and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display total documents uploaded in a sidebar summary
2. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL show the number of chunks stored
3. WHEN queries are made THEN the system SHALL track and display the total number of queries made
4. WHEN multiple documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide a visualization showing chunks per document
5. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates

### Requirement 8: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean, modern, and intuitive interface, so that I can easily navigate and use the system for demonstrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern layout with soft colors
2. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL use rounded buttons and appropriate icons
3. WHEN the system provides a dark mode option THEN users SHALL be able to toggle between light and dark themes
4. WHEN actions are in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN the interface is used THEN it SHALL be suitable for professional client demonstrations and Loom recordings

### Requirement 9: Demo Mode and Testing

**User Story:** As a demonstrator, I want a demo mode that automatically showcases the system's capabilities, so that I can create effective demonstration videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demo mode is activated THEN the system SHALL auto-upload a sample document
2. WHEN demo mode continues THEN the system SHALL populate a test question automatically
3. WHEN demo mode executes THEN the system SHALL automatically perform retrieval and generation
4. WHEN demo mode completes THEN the entire process SHALL finish within 15 seconds for clean demo clips
5. WHEN demo mode is available THEN it SHALL be clearly accessible via a dedicated button

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no files are uploaded and a query is submitted THEN the system SHALL display a clear message
2. WHEN an empty query is submitted THEN the system SHALL show appropriate validation feedback
3. WHEN retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry the operation
5. WHEN any system error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 11: Performance Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging and performance metrics, so that I can monitor system performance and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieval occurs THEN the system SHALL log retrieval time
